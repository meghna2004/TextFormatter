I am designing a text formatting and layout tool in Microsoft dynamics 365. Companies that sell things or provide a service to their customers often send out automated emails, or need certain documents creating. for example, when an order is placed, send an order confirmation email to the customer. or when a customer passes an online assessment, a certificate would get created for them. To help structure business content like that, this tool aims to provide the users with the necessary tools to create templates for these kind of content. 


These are my aims and objectives that i aim to fulfil after delivering this project:

Research Aim:

This project aims to develop a reusable formatting tool within Microsoft Dynamics 365 Power Platform that enables users to create and manage business communication templates efficiently.

Research Objectives:

Design and prototype a formatting tool interface using Microsoft Power Apps in a Model Driven App.

Implement automated formatting logic for templated email/document generation using C#.

Enable the retrieval of business data to put in the templates by using a user inputted FetchXML Query

Enable custom configurations to trigger automated creation of business documents from set templates.

Evaluate the tool’s usability and effectiveness by conducting user testing with real business scenarios.
